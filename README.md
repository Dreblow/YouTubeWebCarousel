# YouTubeWebCarousel
Single containing HTML file to add a YouTube Carousel to an online WYSIWYG web builder, 
for example wix, wordpress, squarespace and more.

TODO
- YouTube controls are hidden after playing starts.
- Carousel seems to have extra padding to the right, would like to clean that up.
